## Introduction

NeuralDocs provides a simple yet powerful API that leverages state-of-the-art technologies to enhance document retrieval and generation. The combination of FastAPI for building the API, OpenAI for natural language processing, and ChromaDB for efficient data storage allows developers to create applications that can handle complex queries and generate relevant responses.

This project serves as a practical example of how to integrate various tools to create a robust application quickly. 

## Features

- **FastAPI**: High-performance web framework for building APIs.
- **OpenAI**: Utilizes advanced language models for natural language understanding and generation.
- **ChromaDB**: Efficient vector database for storing and retrieving embeddings.
- **Docker**: Containerization for easy deployment and scalability.
- **Automatic Code Generation**: Rapidly generate code using OpenAI Codex.

## Technologies Used

- **FastAPI**: For building APIs quickly and efficiently.
- **OpenAI Codex**: For natural language processing and code generation.
- **ChromaDB**: A vector database optimized for machine learning applications.
- **Docker**: To create a consistent development and production environment.
- **Python**: The primary programming language used in this project.
- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: Combines retrieval of documents with generation of text for better context.

## Installation

To get started with NeuralDocs, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zmwzmo11130/neuraldocs.git
   cd neuraldocs
   ```

2. **Set Up the Environment**:
   Make sure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   Install the required packages using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Build the Docker Image**:
   If you want to run the application in a Docker container, build the image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t neuraldocs .
   ```

5. **Run the Application**:
   You can run the application locally using FastAPI:
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```
   Or run it in a Docker container:
   ```bash
   docker run -p 8000:8000 neuraldocs
   ```

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can access it at `http://localhost:8000`. The FastAPI interface provides an interactive documentation page where you can test the API endpoints.

## API Endpoints

### 1. Retrieve Documents

**Endpoint**: `/retrieve`

**Method**: `POST`

**Description**: This endpoint retrieves relevant documents based on a user query.

**Request Body**:
```json
{
  "query": "Your search query here"
}
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "documents": [
    {
      "title": "Document Title",
      "content": "Document content here."
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. Generate Text

**Endpoint**: `/generate`

**Method**: `POST`

**Description**: This endpoint generates text based on a given prompt.

**Request Body**:
```json
{
  "prompt": "Your prompt here"
}
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "generated_text": "Generated text here."
}
```
